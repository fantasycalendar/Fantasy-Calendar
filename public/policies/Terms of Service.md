Welcome to Fantasy-Calendar! Please read these Terms of Use (“Terms”, “Terms of Service”) carefully before using the https://fantasy-calendar.com/ website (the “Service”) operated by Fantasy Calendar Ltd (“us”, “we”, or “our”).

Throughout these Terms, “you” applies to both individuals and entities that access or use our Services. If you are an individual using our Services on behalf of an entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that entity to the Agreement and that by using our Service(s), you are accepting the Agreement on behalf of that entity.

## Terms of Service

Our Services are offered subject to your acceptance, without modification, of all of the terms and conditions contained herein and all other operating rules, policies (including, without limitation, Fantasy Calendar Ltd's Privacy Policy), and procedures that may be published from time to time by Fantasy Calendar Ltd (collectively, the “Agreement”). You agree that we may automatically upgrade our Services, and the Agreement will apply to any upgrades.

Please read the Agreement carefully before accessing or using our Services. By accessing or using any part of our Services, you agree to become bound by the Agreement. If you do not agree to all the terms of the Agreement, then you may not access or use our Services.

## Your Account
Where use of our Services requires an account, you agree to provide us with complete and accurate information when you register for an account. You will be solely responsible and liable for any activity that occurs under your username. You are responsible for keeping your account information up-to-date and for keeping your password secure.

You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and any Service-related website, store, or other content, and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your account and any other actions taken in connection with our Services. You shall not share or misuse your access credentials. You must immediately notify us of any unauthorized uses of your account, store, or website, or of any other breach of security. We will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions.

## User Content
You are responsible for the content ("Content") that you submit to the Service. The Content includes, but is not limited to, calendars, events, user comments, web-links, and image embedding.

1. You may not submit Content to the Service that:

    a. is defamatory, offensive, sexist, homophobic, obscene, harassing, or threatening;
    
    b. is in breach of (i) anyone’s privacy; or (ii) confidentiality;
    
    c. infringes any third parties intellectual property rights;
    
    d. may cause anxiety or encourage racial hatred or violence;
    
    e. may prejudice legal proceedings.
    
3. You must not seek to impersonate a third party or post comments which are falsely attributed to third parties.
4. You must not use the Service for the promotion of products or services or for any purpose other than you own personal, non-commercial use.
5. By contributing to the Service you confirm that it is your own original work and not copied from anyone else or infringing any third party’s intellectual property or other rights and complies with these Terms.
6. We reserve the right to check, edit, moderate, and/or delete Content submitted by you. We reserve the right to prevent you from making comments if you repeatedly breach these Terms of Use. We will not enter into any discussion or correspondence with you or about you if it has decided to modify/delete your comments or to prevent you from commenting on the Service.

As we do not have control over and assume no responsibility for any embedded images in your content, you agree to ensure that the images, should the origin of the image be altered, do not breach any of the Terms outlined above.

## Links To Other Web Sites
As noted beforehand, our Service may contain links to third-party web sites or services that are not owned or controlled by Fantasy Calendar Ltd.

Fantasy Calendar Ltd has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party web sites or services. You further acknowledge and agree that Fantasy Calendar Ltd shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such content, goods, or services available on or through any such web sites or services. The existence of a link to or from one of our Services does not represent or imply that we endorse such website.

We strongly advise you to read the terms and conditions and privacy policies of any third-party web sites or services that you visit.

## Payments and fees
Some of our Services are offered for a fee while other Services may be free with optional paid upgrades, such as the Timekeeper plan (collectively, “Paid Services”). By using a Paid Service, you agree to pay the specified fees. Depending on the Paid Service, there may be a one-time fee or recurring fees. For recurring fees, we’ll bill or charge you for in regular intervals (such as monthly, annually, or biennially), on a pre-pay basis until you cancel, which you can do at any time by cancelling your plan or by contacting us by emailing billing@fantasy-calendar.com.

**Payment.** If your payment fails or Paid Services are otherwise not paid for on time, we may immediately cancel or revoke your access to the Paid Services. If you contact your bank or credit card company to decline or reverse the charge of fees for Paid Services, we may revoke your access to all of our Services until outstanding charges have been paid.

**Automatic Renewal.** To ensure uninterrupted service, recurring Paid Services are automatically renewed. This means that unless you cancel a Paid Service before the end of the applicable subscription period, it will automatically renew, and you authorize us to invoice you or use any payment mechanism we have on record for you to collect the then-applicable subscription fee (as well as any Taxes). Your Paid Services are renewed for the same interval of time. For example, if you purchase a Fantasy-Calendar.com annual plan, you will be charged each year.

**Refunds.** While you may cancel a Paid Service at any time, refunds are issued in our sole discretion, unless otherwise required by applicable law.

**Fee Changes.** We may change our fees at any time. When applicable, we will give you advance notice of the fee changes. If you don’t agree with the fee changes, you can cancel your Paid Service.

The Agreement does not transfer any Fantasy Calendar Ltd or third party intellectual property to you, and all rights, titles, and interest in and to such property will remain solely with Fantasy Calendar Ltd or their respective third party owner.
