     * To the astute: It may not make a ton of sense to have a list of edge-cases
     * that are looped through dynamically from disk in most applications.
     *
     * However, the complexity of problem space that FC has to deal with
     * results in cases where we need a few dozen example calendars to test on.
     * In our case, those calendars come from the main app, and we don't necessarily
     * have peoples' permission to publish the data from those calendars. To avoid
     * violating their wishes, we have our test cases setup in a private repository.
     *
     * Rather than having a single test for every one of the edge cases
     * we can think of, we've just got a bunch of test **calendars** we use for
     * testing that we know can be tricky, which are looped through by our tests.
