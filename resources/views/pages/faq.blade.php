                        answer: `Fantasy-Calendar is a web application that allows you to create your own custom calendars. The calendar doesn't have to be the same as the calendar in our world, it could be from any established fantastic world, or one of your own making. <br><br> So, whether you're a GM looking to track the events of a long-running Forgotten Realms campaign, an author, or simply a world-builder who likes to have wacky celestial configurations (Such as <strong>Eberron's</strong> <a href='http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/ebds/20050307a'>twelve moons</a>) with zany timekeeping systems to match, you probably need a calendar of some kind. Fantasy Calendar aims to make that easy.`

                        text: "The site looks different. What's new?",
                        answer: `You can check out the "<a target='_blank' href='{{ route('whats-new') }}'>what's new</a>" page to see the various updates in broad strokes, or if you want all the nitty gritty details, you can read over the <a target='_blank' href='{{ route('changelog') }}'>changelog</a>.`

                        text: "How can I make a calendar like the one we use in the real world?",
                        answer: `The calendar we use on earth is called the 'Gregorian Calendar', which is understandably confusing. You can find it right there in the presets you can choose from when <a href="{{ route('calendars.create') }}">creating a calendar</a>! Just search for "Earth" or look for "Gregorian Calendar" in the list.`

                        text: "Is there a way to track the weather in my world?",
                        answer: "Yes it can! You'll need <a target='_blank' href='{{ helplink('seasons') }}'>seasons</a> in your calendar and enable <a target='_blank' href='{{ helplink('weather') }}'>weather</a> on it. Then, you have the option to switch <a target='_blank' href='{{ helplink('locations') }}'>locations</a>, which is what actually drives the weather. Between our many preset climate locations, such as Equatorial, Tropical Savanna, Cool and Rainy, and Polar-like, you have plenty of options to simulate your location. If you want something more home-brewed, you can create your own custom locations to best suit the places in your world."

                        answer: "Don't worry! You can find help on our <a target='_blank' href='{{ helplink()  }}'>help docs</a>, which contains detailed information about each feature. If that doesn't solve your issues, you can always join our <a target='_blank' href='https://discord.gg/BNSM7aT'>discord server</a> and ask other Fantasy-Calendar users for a hand."

                        text: "Subscriptions? Isn't Fantasy-Calendar free?",
                        answer: "Fantasy-Calendar is still <strong>completely free to use</strong>! Free accounts can still create up to 2 calendars, with no other limitations. As Fantasy-Calendar has grown, so have our bills. For the last 3 years we have been happily funding the site out of our own pockets and from generous donations from some of our users, but we want Fantasy-Calendar stay online long term. That's why we added some <i>optional</i> premium features that won't hinder you from creating full-fledged calendars!"
